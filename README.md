# Survey Demo

This is a demo application. The goal of this application is to provide a lightweight way to ask users multiple choice questions.

There is a very simple admin interface behind an http auth.

```
user: sumome
pass: 2015
```

## The setup

This app uses Node.js, Express, SequelizeJS, and MySQL.

Make sure MySQL is installed on your computer.


```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Running the app

Once you have your app set up properly, you should be able to go to

 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
